## Overview

This learning module will cover the basics of Python needed for this course. It is by no means exhaustive in the capabilites of Python, but it is enough for a beginner with experience in coding before (see: [Prerequisite Course(s)](../index.qmd#course-info)).

This Learning Module has been adapted from [Think Python 3E](https://allendowney.github.io/ThinkPython/index.html) with some updates for industrial engineering topics as well as my own work.
